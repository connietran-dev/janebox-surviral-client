# SurViral with JANEbox Games

![Surviral homescreen](./public/screenshots/home.png)

## Project Description
SurViral is a multiplayer, storyline game that allows players to work together and defeat a viral enemy to save the world! This project was built as part of the mintbean.io Multiplayer Game Hackathon to build a multiplayer, turn-based online game.

This is the client-side repo which uses web technologies to create the game (as opposed to game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine). We utilized React, React Router, Sass, and Socket.io to create the client-side functionality.

### Project Inspiration

We were inspired by story-centered games, like Life is Strange and the Stranger Things game series, as well as "Choose your own adventure" story/action games, like Pokemon and DnD. We were also inspired by social games like Jackbox Games and wanted collaboration to be an key aspect of the game. While the theme of the game is inspired by real-life events, we also wanted to ensure there was an inspirational and positive goal that all players were working towards.

## Future Goals

The prototype we have developed represents our minimum viable product. However, Surviral has a host of features that we hope to build as part of our future goals for the game, including:

* Special thanks to Nick Morgan who helped write our storyline. We didn't have time to include all of his witty answer choices, but we highly recommend you check them out in our slides.json file on GitHub [here](https://github.com/connietran-dev/janebox-surviral-client/blob/master/src/slides.json). They are hilarious! We hope to incorporate all this great writing in the very near future.
* Having unique goals for each character based on the role the player selects at the beginning of the game
* Creating collaborative decisions on which the team must agree
* Having variable storylines and variable outcomes
* Exploring the concept of opposing teams and/or saboteurs (e.g., Secret Hitler, Werewolf) instead of one collaborative team
* Incorporating a competitive aspect and creating minigames & puzzles
